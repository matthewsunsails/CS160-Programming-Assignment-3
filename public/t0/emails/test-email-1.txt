Hello Mr. President,

It was great to meet you at the gala last week. Attached, you will find my proposed federal legislation, which, if I recall our conversation accurately, you described as "not entirely unhinged" and "admittedly unique."

As we discussed, successful passage of the legislation would completely ban homework in schools and promise universal free ice cream on Fridays. The attached PDF should answer any remaining questions for your staff.

Thank you,

Sen. Fipp
