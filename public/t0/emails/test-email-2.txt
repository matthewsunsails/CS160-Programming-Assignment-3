Dearest father,

I've been absolutely craving that taco soup recipe you used to make when I was a kid. I looked it up and found a slow cooker recipe that seemed promising, but the tomatoes didn't taste right... they were too overpowering.

Is there some trick you used? Or maybe just a different recipe?

Please respond soon. I'm sick of ordering from Sliver every night.

Bobby
